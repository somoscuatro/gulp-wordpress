# Gulp WordPress

A Gulp task collection for WordPress themes and plugins.

## :sparkles: Features

- **Future JS in your hands** — thanks to Browserify and Babel, you can write beautiful ES6 and ES7 JS since now.
- **A lint to rule them all** — You can not do it wrong! Stylelint and ESLint are here to help you to code it cleanly.
- **It's so tiny!** - Every single line of JavaScript and CSS is concatenated and minified. Your pages will load super fast!
- **GoogleFonts injector** - Just list which Google Fonts you want to use and they're automatically inject. Magic, no?
